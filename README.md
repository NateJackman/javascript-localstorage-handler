JavaScript LocalStorage Handler
===========================

A simple, library independent constructor for easing HTML5 LocalStorage handling with JavaScript.

It extends the native LocalStorage API methods allowing for object and array saving and retrieving, returning useful information when called and some more awesomeness.

TODO:
* Implement the events handling via callback - see http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html#storage-event
* Testing with all major browsers
